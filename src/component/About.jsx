          I am a passionate full-stack developer who thrives at the intersection
          of creativity and technology. What started as curiosity for coding and
          design has grown into a mission to craft digital experiences that are
          both visually compelling and functionally powerful. With a strong
          focus on user experience and a drive to stay ahead of evolving trends,
          I strive to deliver solutions that not only meet but redefine
          expectations
